#Project Overview

Public business registration data in Virginia holds valuable insight but is messy, inconsistent, and difficult to work with. FCEDA needed a faster, scalable way to clean, enrich, and visualize this data to support outreach efforts and economic planning.

Our team developed a cloud-based ETL pipeline using AWS and an interactive Tableau dashboard to automate the transformation and visualization of business registration records.

#Problem Statement

Manual data processing was slowing down FCEDAâ€™s ability to:
- Identify and contact newly registered office/industrial businesses
- Validate whether a business is located within Fairfax County
- Visualize trends over time and across geographies

#Our Solution

We created a serverless data pipeline and business intelligence solution:

- AWS Lambda + S3: Automates ingestion, cleaning, and geocoding of business records
- Amazon Location Service: Adds latitude and longitude using address data
- Tableau Dashboard: Enables users to filter by city, ZIP code, incorporation date, and keyword to explore business data visually
- Outpu*: Cleaned CSVs and real-time dashboard updates ready for use in Tableau, Salesforce, and ArcGIS

#Tech Stack

- AWS Lambda (Python)
- Amazon S3
- Amazon Location Service

- Boto3 (AWS SDK for Python)
- Pandas
